Build a project called “MindCare – AI-Powered Mental Health Journal” that supports SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being.

Requirements (must strictly follow):

Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (form for journal input + Chart.js for visualization)

Backend: Python (Flask)

Database: MySQL (store journal entries + emotion results)

AI: Hugging Face Sentiment Analysis API (for mood detection, no ML coding)

Payments: Integrate IntaSend for monetization (premium features, donations, or therapist subscription plans)

How it Should Work:

User writes a daily journal entry in a simple HTML form.

Flask backend sends the text to the Hugging Face Sentiment Analysis API and retrieves emotions (e.g., happy: 72%, sad: 18%).

The results are stored in MySQL along with the user’s journal entry.

The frontend uses Chart.js to show the user’s mood trends over time (line or bar chart).

Add CRUD functionality (users can view, edit, delete entries).

Add IntaSend integration for monetization (e.g., premium feature: advanced mood reports, or therapist support access).

Deliverables:

Clean, well-documented code.

README file with:

Team members’ names, roles, and emails.

Setup instructions (how to run Flask + MySQL locally).

API usage documentation (Hugging Face + IntaSend).

Testing: Ensure CRUD works, emotions are stored correctly, and chart updates dynamically.

Hackathon Judging Alignment:

Code Quality (20%) → Clean Flask routes, organized JS, SQL schema well-structured.

Algorithm Efficiency (20%) → Efficient API calls, optimized queries.

Tech Utilization (14%) → Proper integration of Hugging Face, Chart.js, IntaSend.

Security (12%) → Basic validation + error handling for API/DB.

Performance (16%) → Responsive frontend and optimized backend queries.

Development Process (10%) → Collaborative README with roles.

Documentation & Testing (8%) → Clear instructions and working tests.

⚡ This prompt ensures Replit AI won’t hallucinate because it:

Clearly defines the problem (mental health support)

Strictly enforces the tech stack
