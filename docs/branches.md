# Branch Documentation

This document outlines the purpose and usage of key branches in this repository.

## main

*   **Purpose**: The primary branch representing the latest stable and deployable version of the project. All new features and bug fixes are eventually merged into `main` after thorough testing.
*   **Usage**:
    *   Do not commit directly to `main`.
    *   Always create feature branches or bugfix branches from `main`.
    *   Ensure all changes are reviewed and tested before merging into `main`.
